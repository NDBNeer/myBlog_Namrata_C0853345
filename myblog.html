                <h4>My Journey : What 3 Years of Android Development Have Taught Me the Hard Way</h4>
                <p>Here I’m writing this post to share all about my journey through Android development which has taught me many lessons. I am writing this article because it could be helpful to many people out there who are facing problems like me.</p>
                <p>Back in Mid-2016 after graduation I started my first job. Later in the start of 2017 I decided to start my career in Android Development, and that was one of the best decisions I took in my life. I got a chance to work in an Android Application and to learn a lot of things in Android. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Initially when I started Android, I didn’t have a mentor or someone who could guide me to do things the right way. I made a lot of mistakes and also wasted a lot of time doing and later rectifying them but the good thing is I learn a lot from my mistakes.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">During this period I learned what to do and most importantly what to not do. You know what to not do is the most important in coding then what to do. That's funny I know, Nevertheless, Here I am going to share with you some ultimate learning techniques which I learned during my journey. May helps someone to get started and not repeat the mistakes that I once did.</p><br/>
